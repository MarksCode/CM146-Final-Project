## CM146 Final Project - A TagPro Bot

##### Instructions to use the script:

1. Install [Tampermonkey Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en).

2. In the extension, create a new script, place contents of TP_Bot.js inside, and save.

3. Go to [TagPro Maptest Server](http://maptest3.newcompte.fr/) and make a new group.

4. Join the red team and launch the game, these are recommended settings:
    1. Map: Open Field Masters (this will eventually be the labyrinth we'll create)
    2. Waiting Time: 1 Second (reduces countdown before game start)

5. Bot behavior should take over at this point!

6. If you want to add another player to the game (i.e. the human player), open another browser (Firefox, Safari, etc.), join group and using group link, and join the game.
